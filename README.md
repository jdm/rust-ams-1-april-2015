## Cargo

* Nothing here yet

## Servo

* Nothing here yet

## Rustc

Advice: try to build the compiler from source before the meetup, since you will need to compile LLVM wich can take about an hour.

* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/21435 ([aochagavia](https://github.com/aochagavia) can mentor)

## Rust Rosetta

* Add new solutions to rosseta-code problems (see https://github.com/Hoverbear/rust-rosetta for more information; [aochagavia](https://github.com/aochagavia) can mentor)
